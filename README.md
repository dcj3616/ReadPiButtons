# ReadPiButtons
These Python programs will read buttons connected to GPIO pins, showing button down times and inactivity times.

Currently I have 2 versions of the same basic program:
    btn33a.py   which is for the Adafruit 4484 2-button display
    btn33b.py   which is for the Adafruit 4506 7-button display 
    
It should be a simple extension to test GPIO buttons for any other project.
